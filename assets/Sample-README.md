# Professional README Generator 
![Apache 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-blue?style=for-the-badge)

## Description
  
This is an application built using JavaScript, Node.js and inquirer library. It is initialized using the command line, typing node index.js. The user then gets prompted with a series of questions about each of the sections of a Professional README.md file, like Title, Description, Installation Instructions, Usage, Contributing, Tests, License and Questions. As soon as the user answers the last question the application generates a README.md file with all the information provided for each section (a table of contents with links to each section es created as well).
